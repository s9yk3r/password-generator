<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Main View][product-screenshot]

There are already a billion applications like this out there, but considering that I'm learning to take advantage of the potential of VueJS Single File Components and that I'm just starting to get into the world of Node.js, I thought it would be fun to create a little random password generator that can help you get rid of the usual passwords like "123456" or "password"... or... "drowssap?" Come on, I know you use them too!

### Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/s9yk3r/password-generator.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. To simply run the application in a dev environment
   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```
4. Or, build the application
   ```sh
   npm build
   ```
<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

The application is as simple as it sounds. Simply start the application
and customize the available settings as you wish. You can generate
a short (min. 6 characters) or very long (max. 255 characters) password, and you can decide which characters the password should contain! You can select
only letters (both lowercase and uppercase), only numbers (0-9) or only special characters (characters includes: !$@#%&?^) or... well, all these combinations together!
Once finished, just press the generate button and magically your new, strong password will appear in the space provided. Once you are satisfied with your new password,
you can press the "copy" button and copy it to the clipboard! Nice, isn't it?
